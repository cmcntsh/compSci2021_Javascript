# JavaScript Programming

This is part of a set of pages on introduction to computer science. https://github.com/cmcntsh/IntroCompSci2021_topics

This week we're going to start learning JavaScript. JavaScript is the language that helps make web pages more interactive. However, JavaScript is not just for web pages. JavaScript is used in many areas of application development. In addition, you'll find the programming principles you learn in JavaScript hold true for many other programming languages. JavaScript has been going through a lot of changes in the last several years. Older tutorials and materials for absolute beginners lack examples of more current approaches to JavaScript programming. I have added more current tutorials in the Optional Material section should you be interested in learning more. Other developments may change web programming further. First, the creator of JavaScript created a new language called TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to overcome some of the perceived limitations of JavaScript in the areas of variable typing and code execution security. Use of TypeScript is expanding. Second, Web Assembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a platform supported in many web browsers which allows for the execution of compiled code directly in the browser. Compiled programs are able to run faster than interpreted languages like JavaScript. This opens the door for more complex applications and applications developed in many other languages to be delivered over the web. (https://webassembly.org/, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly (Links to an external site.)) Neither of these emerging trends have supplanted JavaScript and they may never completely replace JavaScript, but they promise to cause a significant shift in how dynamic and interactive web content are delivered. I want to put them on your radar so you can pay attention as these changes take place. They are sure to affect how we go about our work in informatics in the future.
