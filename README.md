# JavaScript Programming

This is part of a set of pages on introduction to computer science. https://github.com/cmcntsh/IntroCompSci2021_topics

This week we're going to start learning JavaScript. JavaScript is the language that helps make web pages more interactive. However, JavaScript is not just for web pages. JavaScript is used in many areas of application development. In addition, you'll find the programming principles you learn in JavaScript hold true for many other programming languages. JavaScript has been going through a lot of changes in the last several years. Older tutorials and materials for absolute beginners lack examples of more current approaches to JavaScript programming. I have added more current tutorials in the Optional Material section should you be interested in learning more. Other developments may change web programming further. First, the creator of JavaScript created a new language called TypeScript (https://www.typescriptlang.org/) to overcome some of the perceived limitations of JavaScript in the areas of variable typing and code execution security. Use of TypeScript is expanding. Second, Web Assembly (abbreviated Wasm) is a platform supported in many web browsers which allows for the execution of compiled code directly in the browser. Compiled programs are able to run faster than interpreted languages like JavaScript. This opens the door for more complex applications and applications developed in many other languages to be delivered over the web. (https://webassembly.org/, https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/WebAssembly (Links to an external site.)) Neither of these emerging trends have supplanted JavaScript and they may never completely replace JavaScript, but they promise to cause a significant shift in how dynamic and interactive web content are delivered. I want to put them on your radar so you can pay attention as these changes take place. They are sure to affect how we go about our work in informatics in the future.

* 2021 note: I'm a bit conflicted about the JavaScript content. The BMI department worked with VSchool to get access to this HTML-CSS-JavaScript primer course. It's a nice start, but it doesn't really get you up to speed with current practice in programming with JavaScript. I did a bit of searching and posted some additional material in the Optional Material section, but I haven't fallen in love with any of those resources either. I'm currently reviewing a course on Udemy. ( https://www.udemy.com/course/modern-javascript-from-the-beginning/ (Links to an external site.) ) If you work for Intermountain Healthcare you can access Udemy content for free. ( https://intermountain.udemy.com/organization/home/ (Links to an external site.) ) If you don't work for Intermountain, then Udemy offers a subscription plan ($30/month can cancel any time) or course purchase with lifetime access ($99 for this one). So far, it's the best thing I've seen. Starting from just the first few videos, it's been filling in some gaps I've had despite having reviewed quite a few free resources. If I were taking this course and I didn't have free access to Udemy, I would consider subscribing to Udemy for a month or two to review the material in this paid resource (and take some good notes). I don't know about the rest of you, but I can say I've invested thousands of dollars in buying text books over the course of my academic career. If you're really interested in getting more proficient in JavaScript, then a month or two subscription to Udemy seems like a sound investment. I have not felt the need to require the purchase of a text for this course. (A good number of the texts I purchased while I was doing my graduate coursework are good for doorstops now because informatics and computer content updates at breakneck speed.) But I think this might actually be a good place to spend a bit of money if you're really interested in going farther with JavaScript than we do in this class. I did all the assignments with just the links above, some of the links in the optional material section, and some Googling last year, so you're probably fine if you want to stick with this for now. If any of you finds a free/low cost resource which you feel is an improvement over the current content, please let me know about it.
* I watched the videos about the basics of JavaScript and took some notes. I'll share those here. They won't be as good as watching the videos, but they'll give you an idea of some of the things that are a bit more current/complete. (See zip file in this repository.)
